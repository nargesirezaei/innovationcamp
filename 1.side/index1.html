            <h1>Do you now 260 million children are out of school </h1>
            <p>Hundreds of schools around the world have been attacked - disrupting or ending the education of many children. A shocking report last year revealed more than 14,000 attacks on education - including about 10,000 directly on schools
            - in 34 countries over a five-year period.
            The Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack said: "Buildings were bombed, damaged or used by armed forces or groups, sometimes making them inaccessible to students. Nine countries each suffered more than 500 attacks on schools."

             Schools were occupied for military purposes in at last 30 countries. Female students and teachers in particular were targeted - including through the bombings of girls’ schools, abduction, rape and harassment at school and on the routes students take to school.

             <h2 >Children and poverty</h2>
            <p>As like some endless war, poverty is destroying innocent lives. Among its most hapless victims are millions upon
                millions of children who are born into poverty or become impoverished during childhood owing to events outside their control.It is not just that children find their own fate being shaped by life’s chances rather thanthemselves. 
                Children also are poverty’s innocent victims because their voice is rarely counted and, too often, discounted.
                Children cannot vote. They cannot form assemblies or petition authorities for programs that could alleviate some of the conditions they are suffering.</p>
            
                <p> In the official statistics of most countries, children often are not even included. Children’s virtual absence from policy debates on poverty is particularly poignant considering that they typically are over-represented among the poor.When a family is poor, for every deprived adult there may be two or more children suffering the ill consequences of poverty. In poor households, parents may try everything to meet their children’s basic survival needs, often at their own expense. But among better-off families, children may surprisingly suffer from want because they are not receiving their corresponding share of resources.</p>
